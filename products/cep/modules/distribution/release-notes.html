<p>WSO2 CEP is a lightweight and easy-to-use Open Source Complex Event Processing
   Server (CEP) is available under the Apache Software License v2.0.WSO2 Complex
   Event Processor identifies the most meaningful events within the event cloud,
   analyzes their impacts, and acts on them in real time. Its built to be extremely
   high performing and massively scalable.
</p>

<p>This is based on the revolutionary <a
        href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">WSO2 Carbon platform</a>,
   and is based on the OSGi framework to achieve the better modularity for
   your Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). This also contains a lots of new
   features and many other optional components to customize the behavior of the
   server. Further, if you do not want any of the built in features, you can
   uninstall those features without any trouble. In other words, CEP can be
   customized to your SOA needs. </p>


<p>WSO2 Complex Event Processor is shipped with Siddhi and supports plugable back end
   runtimes as features which can be installed via WSO2 Carbon Feature Management.
   Siddhi is a Complex Event processing Engine developed by WSO2 engineers to achieve very high
   performance and massive scalability</p>
